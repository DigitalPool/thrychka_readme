# Folder Synchronization Script

This Python script synchronizes the contents of a source folder with a replica folder. It continuously copies new or updated files and directories from the source to the replica, while also deleting files or directories in the replica that no longer exist in the source. All operations are logged to a file for later review.

## Features

- **Automatic Synchronization:** Continuously monitors the source folder and updates the replica folder based on changes.
- **Intelligent Copying:** Copies new files and updates files if the source version is newer.
- **Deletion of Orphaned Files:** Removes files or directories in the replica that do not exist in the source.
- **Logging:** All activities are logged in a specified directory (`logfile.log` is created automatically).
- **Command-Line Interface:** Easily specify the source, replica, synchronization interval, and log file directory via command-line arguments.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (the script uses only Pythonâ€™s standard libraries: `sys`, `os`, `time`, `shutil`, `argparse`, and `logging`).

## How It Works

1. **Logging Setup (`add_logfile`):**
   The script creates the specified log directory if it doesn't exist and sets up a log file (`logfile.log`) where all synchronization events are recorded.

2. **Copying Files and Folders (`copying_from_src`):**
   - Checks if the replica folder exists; if not, it creates it.
   - Iterates over items in the source folder:
     - **Files:** Copies the file if it doesn't exist in the replica or if the source file has been updated.
     - **Directories:** Copies entire directories if they don't exist in the replica. If the directory exists, it performs a recursive check to ensure all new or updated files are copied.

3. **Deleting Files and Folders (`delete_from_dest`):**
   - Iterates over items in the replica folder:
     - **Files:** Deletes any file not present in the source.
     - **Directories:** Deletes any directory (or parts thereof) that no longer exist in the source.

4. **Continuous Synchronization (`main`):**
   The script uses an infinite loop to continuously synchronize the folders at a user-defined time interval. It gracefully handles a `KeyboardInterrupt` (Ctrl+C) to stop the process.

## Usage

### Command-Line Arguments

The script requires four positional arguments:

1. **source:** Path to the source folder.
2. **replica:** Path to the replica folder.
3. **interval:** Synchronization interval in seconds.
4. **logfile:** Path to the directory where the log file should be stored.

### Example

Assuming the script is named `sync.py`, you can run it from the command line as follows:

```bash
python sync.py /path/to/source /path/to/replica 10 /path/to/logs
```

In this example:
- `/path/to/source` is the folder to be monitored.
- `/path/to/replica` is the folder that will be updated to mirror the source.
- `10` is the time interval (in seconds) between each synchronization.
- `/path/to/logs` is where the log file (`logfile.log`) will be stored.

## Stopping the Script

To stop the synchronization process, press `Ctrl+C`. The script will catch the `KeyboardInterrupt` and exit gracefully.

## Customization and Future Enhancements

- **Error Handling:** More robust error handling can be implemented for production environments.
- **Bidirectional Sync:** Currently, the script syncs only from the source to the replica. Future versions could support bidirectional synchronization.
- **Configuration File:** You may add a configuration file to customize settings without modifying the command-line interface.
